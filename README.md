I am a second year PhD student in the genetics program at NC State University. I am interested in conservation genetics, and I am currently studying dogs living around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.





## Abstract

“Dogs of Chernobyl: A model for human health effects arising from chronic exposure to radiation, heavy metals, and other environmental toxins.”

In 1986, a steam explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) destroyed reactor 4, releasing an incredible amount of radioactive debris into the atmosphere, and contaminating surrounding regions of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia with more than 1018 Bq of various radioisotopes. Within 48 hrs, authorities evacuated ~50,000 residents of Pripyat, and thousands of others from dozens of towns and villages within a 30 km radius of the NPP. To limit the spread of radiation, teams of “Liquidators” were sent in to euthanize agricultural livestock and pets left behind. Nevertheless, some dogs escaped destruction. Today, a population of several hundred semi-domesticated animals live around the NPP and Chernobyl City, receiving handouts from several thousand workers still employed there. The region is still heavily contaminated by 137-Cs, 90-Sr, heavy/toxic metals, organics, and chemicals left over from decontamination efforts, deconstruction, and 35 years of decay of this former industrial complex as well as a nearby military base. Genetic effects of these toxic exposures on the resident canine population are still unclear. Two populations of semi-feral dogs; one living around the NPP and another living ~18 km away in Chernobyl City are being studied. Preliminary analyses highlight genetic differentiation between these populations and candidate outlier loci within the NPP population. We hope to 1) identify local adaptation, methylation differences, and differential expression between the NPP and Chernobyl City populations and, 2) relate these genetic impacts of chronic exposures on animal health. The subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster, as well as potential future large-scale nuclear or industrial accidents, highlights an urgent need to better understand how such exposures can adversely impact the genome and epigenome. Findings from these dogs are likely to provide vital insights concerning identification of biomarkers of human exposure that can predict subsequent adverse health outcomes after future environmental disasters.
