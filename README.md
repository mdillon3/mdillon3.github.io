I am a second year PhD student in the genetics program at NC State University. I am interested in conservation genetics, and I am currently studying dogs living around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.





## Abstract

“Dogs of Chernobyl: A model for human health effects arising from chronic exposure to radiation, heavy metals, and other environmental toxins.”

In 1986, an explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) released 1018 Bq of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere, contaminating surrounding regions of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Within 48 hours of the accident, the residents of Pripyat and several other towns within a 30 km radius of the NPP were evacuated. Authorities worried that animals left behind could spread radiation and sent in teams of “Liquidators” to euthanize agricultural livestock and abandoned pets. Some dogs managed to escape destruction. Today, a population of several hundred semi-domesticated animals live around the NPP. The region is still heavily contaminated by 137-Cs, 90-Sr, heavy/toxic metals, organics, and chemicals left from the accident and from decontamination efforts. The effects of these toxic exposures on the genetics of the resident canine population are still unclear. This study focuses on two populations of semi-feral dogs with varied exposures: one living around the NPP and another living ~13 km away in Chernobyl City. Through population genetic analyses, we hope to 1) identify local adaptation and differential expression between the NPP and Chernobyl City populations and 2) relate these genetic impacts to the chronic exposures and animal health. A growing dependance of nuclear energy as well as the subsequent Fukushima disaster highlight an urgent need to better understand how such exposures can adversely impact the genome and epigenome. Findings from this population of dogs can provide vital insights concerning identification of biomarkers of human exposure that can predict subsequent adverse health outcomes after future environmental disasters.
