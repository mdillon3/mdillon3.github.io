## About Me
I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the genetics program at North Carolina State University. I am studying the genetics of dogs living around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

## ABSTRACT
In 1986, an explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant released hundreds of tons of radioactive debris that contaminated the surrounding environments. In addition to the radioactive materials, the area surrounding the power plant was further contaminated by subsequent remediation efforts which introduced heavy metals, organics, and other hazardous compounds. While the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is the site of the world's largest nuclear disaster and produced an extremely unique environment, there are 1,877 sites in the United States that the Environmental Protection Agency recognizes as superfund sites, defined as a polluted location that requires long-term cleanup. These areas can contain harmful chemical and environmental toxicants, such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, and pose a threat to local inhabitants. Many species of wildlife still inhabit Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) where they have been continuously exposed to the harmful environment for potentially many generations. Our research focuses on unowned, semi-feral dogs living within the CEZ: one population living around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and one living 16 km away in Chernobyl City. By studying their genetics, we can better predict how humans and wildlife living in similarly harsh environments may be impacted. Through genetic analyses of these semi-feral dogs, we have identified a striking level of genetic diversity between a population at the power plant and other, outside populations, and evidence suggestive of directional selection. Though once domestic, these now free-breeding dogs will provide insights towards the genetic response of exposed communities to environmental contaminants.
