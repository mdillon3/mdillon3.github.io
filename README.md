## About Me
I am a third year PhD student in the genetics program at North Carolina State University. I am currently studying the genetics of dogs living around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.





## Abstract

### Search for Local Adaptation in Dogs Living in Chernobyl

The 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) disaster released roughly 5,000 petabecquerels of radioisotopes into the surrounding environment. A roughly ~30 km radius surrounding the NPP, named the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), was evacuated, and remains predominantly abandoned to this day. In addition to radioactive contamination, initial remediation efforts, as well as various abandoned military and industrial facilities, have resulted in release of toxic/heavy metals, organics, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. Despite an attempt to eliminate all domestic and agricultural animals shortly after the accident, several hundred dogs, presumably descendants of abandoned household pets, now inhabit the CEZ. This study focused on two populations of these dogs, one living around the NPP and one living approximately 16.5 km away in Chernobyl City. We aimed to quantify the degree of local adaptation of NPP dogs to the multi-generational exposures of various hazardous materials. We have worked towards elucidating the population structure of these dogs and identified outlier loci that are indicative of genomic regions under candidate positive selection. We found a significant degree of genetic differentiation, despite some amount of overlap and genetic similarity between the populations. Outlier analysis highlighted 52 candidate genes, with Gene Ontology terms relating to response to ionizing radiation and DNA damage signaling. These putative candidate genes are being pursued to identify potential variants that may be under selection. Our findings add to the general understanding of the genetic effects from prolonged exposure to radiation, heavy metals, and other contaminants.
